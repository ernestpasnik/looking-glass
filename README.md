## Introduction
A lightweight Looking Glass built with **Node.js** and **Bootstrap 5.3**, this project draws heavy inspiration from [Hybula Looking Glass](https://github.com/hybula/lookingglass). Check out the [live demo](https://lg-de-fra.erpa.cc/), which features the Cosmo theme from Bootswatch.

## Requirements
- Linux
- Node.js

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate into the directory. Rename `config.dist.json` to `config.json`. You can customize the stylesheet value in `config.json` to use a [Bootswatch theme](https://bootswatch.com/) and set the `themeMode` to either `light` or `dark`. Finally, run the application through a reverse proxy to access it.
